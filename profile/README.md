Our work focuses primarily on structural MRI imaging in functional neurosurgery with a special interest in neuropathic pain.
Projects also exist in international neurosurgical education to strengthen neurosurgical capacity in low and middle-income countries.

On this site, we collect the code related resources. For further information about the lab, please visit our [homepage](https://www.hodaielab.com).
